# dotfiles
my dotfiles bc people want them for some reason

idk why ur here, but since u are heres some info:
- im too lazy to make an install script
- im using Yosemite-San-Francisco font, so u might need to install that
- im using awesome font for icons & stuff so ull need that too
- im not sure if the arc-darker theme got through, but if it didn't that's the theme im using
- i had to censor this a bit for privacy, so some parts might be missing, sorry
